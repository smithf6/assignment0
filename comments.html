    <h1>
        A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace<br>
        by John Perry Barlow
    </h1>
    <p>
        Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from<br>
        Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to<br>
        leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we<br>
        gather.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you<br>
        with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare<br>
        the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies<br>
        you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess<br>
        any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.
    </p>
    <p>
        Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither<br>
        solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us, nor<br>
        do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think<br>
        that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You cannot. It is<br>
        an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create<br>
        the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics, or the<br>
        unwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could be obtained<br>
        by any of your impositions. You claim there are problems among us that you need to<br>
        solve. You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these<br>
        problems don't exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will<br>
        identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social<br>
        Contract. This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world, not<br>
        yours. Our world is different.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a<br>
        standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both<br>
        everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.

    </p>
    <p>
        We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by<br>
        race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no<br>
        matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity
    </p>
    <p>
        Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not<br>
        apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no matter here

        <p><i>One of the most contentious things about the internet is intellectual property.<br>
                Citizens of goverments share and sell their work online, and want protections from<br>
                theft and resale. Other people believe in a broader sense of fair use and ablity<br>
                to share content freely.</i></p>
    </details>
    <p>
        Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical<br>
        coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the<br>
        commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across<br>
        many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent cultures would<br>
        generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able to build our<br>
        particular solutions on that basis. But we cannot accept the solutions you are<br>
        attempting to impose.

        <p><i>This part of the essay seems to imply there arent physical outcomes in the real world that<br>
                governments would be concerned about. One example of a real outcome of the cyberspace is the<br>
                eviornmental impact of computer hardware and cryptocurrency farming.</i><br>

        In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications Reform<br>
        Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson,<br>
        Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These dreams must now<br>
        be born anew in us.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world where you will<br>
        always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust your bureaucracies with<br>
        the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to confront yourselves. In our<br>
        world, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from the debasing to the<br>
        angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits. We cannot<br>
        separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.
    </p>
    <p>
        In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States, you are<br>
        trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of<br>
        Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but they will not<br>
        work in a world that will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media.

        <p><i>Here is some good foresight from the author to notice the eventual major<br>
                impact media corporations would have on the internet.</i></p>

    <p>
        Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by<br>
        proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself<br>
        throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial<br>
        product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may<br>
        create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global<br>
        conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
        These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position as<br>
        those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the<br>
        authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our virtual selves<br>
        immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our<br>
        bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our<br>
        thoughts
    </p>
    <p>
        We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and<br>
        fair than the world your governments have made before.
